# BaseException	                     The base class for all built-in exceptions.
# Exception	                         The base class for all non-exit exceptions.
# ArithmeticError	                 Base class for all errors related to arithmetic operations.
# ZeroDivisionError	                 Raised when a division or modulo operation is performed with zero as the divisor.
# OverflowError	Raised               when a numerical operation exceeds the maximum limit of a data type.
# FloatingPointError	             Raised when a floating-point operation fails.
# AssertionError	                 Raised when an assert statement fails.
# AttributeError	                 Raised when an attribute reference or assignment fails.
# IndexError	                     Raised when a sequence subscript is out of range.
# KeyError	                         Raised when a dictionary key is not found.
# MemoryError	                     Raised when an operation runs out of memory.
# NameError	                         Raised when a local or global name is not found.
# OSError	                         Raised when a system-related operation (like file I/O) fails.
# TypeError	                         Raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type.
# ValueError	                     Raised when a function receives an argument of the right type but inappropriate value.
# ImportError                    	 Raised when an import statement has issues.
# ModuleNotFoundError           	 Raised when a module cannot be found.
# IOError	                         Raised when an I/O operation (like reading or writing to a file) fails.
# FileNotFoundError	                 Raised when a file or directory is requested but cannot be found.
# StopIteration                      Raised when the next() function is called and there are no more items in an iterator.
# KeyboardInterrupt                  Raised when the user presses Ctrl+C or interrupts the programâ€™s execution.
# SystemExit	                     Raised when the sys.exit() function is called to exit the program.
# NotImplementedError	             Raised when an abstract method that needs to be implemented is called.
# RuntimeError                       Raised when a general error occurs in the program.
# RecursionError	                 Raised when the maximum recursion depth is exceeded.
# SyntaxError	                     Raised when there is an error in the syntax of the code.
# IndentationError                   Raised when there is an indentation error in the code.
# TabError	                         Raised when the indentation consists of inconsistent use of tabs and spaces.
# UnicodeError	                     Raised when a Unicode-related encoding or decoding error occurs.
